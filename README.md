# github-tab

*Update*

When you are fine with adjusting your habbits to official standards, you can go
with `cmd+enter` to submit comments. That way you do not need to use this
extension. At the time writing this extension I was not aware of this shortcut.

This Google Chrome extension fixes one annoying issue of the recent Github web
UI upgrade. The issue is when reviewing pull requests, you write comments and
usually hitting the tab key puts the browser focus on the submit button, so you
actually create the comment. The recent Github upgrade of the web UI broke this
convenient behavior. Thus I created this Chrome extension, because I got
trapped several times.

Note that the javascript is hacky and I just wrote it down to make it work. I
have no clue about Chrome extensions, so I simply used http://extensionizr.com
to help me with the boilerplate.

I am a lazy fuck and did not publish the extension to the Chrome appstore. That
means you need to install it yourself. See this [guide for information about
the installation in dev
mode](http://www.howtogeek.com/233355/how-to-install-extensions-from-outside-the-chrome-web-store-and-firefox-add-ons-gallery/).

Enjoy!
